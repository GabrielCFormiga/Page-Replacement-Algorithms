### C++ Implementation of Page Replacement Algorithms

In this repository, I implemented three page replacement algorithms in C++: First-in, First-out (FIFO) and Least Recently Used (LRU)

### How to Run

1. Compile the C++ files with `g++ ./src/*.cpp -I ./include/ -o main`.
2. Run the compiled executable with `./main ./data/instance.txt`.
